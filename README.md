A board game search and discovery tool powered by the BoardGameGeek (BGG) platform, the worldâ€™s leading database for tabletop games. Users can search for games by name and access detailed information including descriptions, authors, number of players, playtime, designers and artists. Additionally, the app allows lookup by BGG username to display a user's game collection (game library), with full access to individual game details.
